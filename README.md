Rationale
========
The project was done as a part of the Hootsuite Women's Hackathon.

The Hackathon was using the PhoneGap Framework which we used for developing the mobile app. (We also used Parse). 

It is basically a prototype of how an app might look with this functionality.


Purpose
=======
Mobile device app that notifies you when within proximity of errand locations


Details
=======
The app is designed to have a user add tasks (like a to-do list). The tasks they categorize (via pre-set list).

Eg. Deposit Cheque IN <type> (where the type is BANK)

When the user is near the <type> (any bank for example), then the user will recieve a notification.

The app includes an embedded map which will show the user nearby points of interest, with the associated tasks for which
they may be able to complete the task at.
